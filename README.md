# NER_USING_BI-LSTM
- Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a task of Natural Language Processing to identify the named entities in a certain piece of text. 
Eg: Name of a person, Name of an organization etc..
- I have used BI-LSTM model for this task.
- <p> You can find the dataset <a herf="https://github.com/NAVANEETHELITE/NER_USING_BI-LSTM/blob/master/DATA/new_ner.csv">here.</a></p>
- Sample prediction of the model is shown below:
